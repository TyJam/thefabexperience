       <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Brook Baker is a brilliant example of following ones dream.</p>
      <p> As a child she developed a love for cooking and spent hours upon hours learning from the greats by studying recipe books
           from renowned chefs such as Julia child, Jacque Pepin, Martin Yan.</p>
     <p> She recalls the blissful
        moments of watching cooking shows on TV and the thrill of trying new recipes with her
        mother on weekends. However, her childhood hobby was just an appetizer that fuelled her
        hunger and she decided to satisfy this craving at 33 by enrolling at the Institute of Culinary
          Education.</p>
     <p>
         Brook’s passion for cooking deepened and she took that faithful step and opened her very
        own catering business The Fab Experience 4 years ago. Her dedication and personality
        paints a vivid picture of her philosophy to provide good food and a happy, joyful experience.</p>
      <p>She stands by her customers and takes great delight in providing an experience that builds
        lasting relationships. Brook values the beauty that comes with a simple, laidback atmosphere
        that exudes class and elegance.
